# Design Patterns That Scale: Building Elegant Java Applications Like a Pro

This repository contains Java implementations of various design patterns, demonstrated as part of the talk **"Design Patterns That Scale: Building Elegant Java Applications Like a Pro"** by **Sahithya B A**.

## Design Patterns Included

### Behavioral Patterns
1. **Memento Pattern**  
   - **File:** MementoPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Captures and restores an object's state without exposing its internals.

2. **State Pattern**  
   - **File:** StatePattern.java  
   - **Description:** Changes an object's behavior based on its internal state.

3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**  
   - **File:** ChainOfResponsibilityPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Passes requests through a chain of handlers until one handles it.

4. **Mediator Pattern**  
   - **File:** MediatorPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Mediates communication between objects to reduce coupling.

5. **Command Pattern**  
   - **File:** CommandPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Encapsulates actions as objects, supporting undo functionality.

6. **Observer Pattern**  
   - **File:** ObserverPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Allows objects to subscribe and react to state changes in another object.

### Structural Patterns
1. **Bridge Pattern**  
   - **File:** BridgePattern.java  
   - **Description:** Decouples abstraction from implementation.

2. **Flyweight Pattern**  
   - **File:** FlyweightPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Shares common state between objects to reduce memory usage.

3. **Composite Pattern**  
   - **File:** CompositePattern.java  
   - **Description:** Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

4. **Proxy Pattern**  
   - **File:** ProxyPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

5. **Facade Pattern**  
   - **File:** FacadePattern.java  
   - **Description:** Simplifies interaction with a complex subsystem.

6. **Adapter Pattern**  
   - **File:** AdapterPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Converts one interface into another that clients expect.

7. **Decorator Pattern**  
   - **File:** DecoratorPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Adds functionality to objects dynamically.

### Creational Patterns
1. **Builder Pattern**  
   - **File:** BuilderPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Constructs complex objects step-by-step.

2. **Factory Pattern**  
   - **File:** FactoryPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Creates objects without specifying their concrete classes.

3. **Singleton Pattern**  
   - **File:** SingletonPattern.java  
   - **Description:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

### Other Files
- **HelloWorld.java**  
   - **File:** HelloWorld.java  
   - **Description:** A simple "Hello, World!" program.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Compile and run any `.java` file using the terminal:
   ```bash
   javac <filename>.java
   java <filename>
   ```
   Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to execute.
